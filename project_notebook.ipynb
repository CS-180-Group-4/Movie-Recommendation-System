That is until one night, a seemingly small event changes Dr. Tenma's life forever. While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience. So when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. Nine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the one he saved.\"\n",

    "1. The method `vectorizeData` has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `X`: A pandas DataFrame containing the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `max_df`:  A float or integer representing the maximum document frequency threshold. Terms with a document frequency higher than this threshold will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `min_df`: An integer representing the minimum document frequency threshold. Terms with a document frequency lower than this threshold will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `custom_stop_words`: A dictionary of custom stop words to be added to the existing English stop words.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `verbose`: A boolean indicating whether to print additional information during the vectorization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It combines the existing English stop words along with the custom stop words provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It creates an instance of the `TfidfVectorizer` class, which is a subclass of `CountVectorizer`. `CountVectorizer` is responsible for converting a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It sets the parameters of the TfidfVectorizer instance, including `max_df`, `min_df`, and `stop_words`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It measures the time it takes to vectorize the data by calling the `fit_transform` method of the `TfidfVectorizer` instance on the input data `X`. This method converts the raw data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.\n",

    "#### Dimensionality Reduction\n",

    "In performing dimensional reduction, the following steps were done.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The method `reduceDim` has the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `X`: A pandas DataFrame representing the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `num_comp`: An integer specifying the desired dimensionality of the output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `normalizer_copy`: A boolean indicating whether to create a copy of the normalizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `verbose`: A boolean indicating whether to print verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The method first creates a pipeline using the `make_pipeline` function, which chains together the TruncatedSVD transformer and the Normalizer transformer. The TruncatedSVD transformer performs the dimensionality reduction, while the Normalizer transformer normalizes the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, the method fits the pipeline to the input data (`X`) using the `fit_transform method`. This step reduces the dimensionality of the data and returns the transformed data (`X_lsa`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The method then calculates the explained variance of the SVD step and the time taken for the dimensionality reduction. If the `verbose` parameter is set to `True`, it prints the time taken and the explained variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, the method returns the transformed data (`X_lsa`) and the pipeline (`lsa`)."
